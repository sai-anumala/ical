This project is an Internal Marks Calculator, designed to help students calculate their internal marks based on their performance in assignments and midterm exams. The calculator takes inputs for two assignments and two midterm exams, each with specific maximum marks (10 for assignments and 35 for midterms). The program then calculates the average of the assignment marks and a weighted average of the midterm marks, where the higher midterm score has more weight.

The result is displayed as the total internal marks out of 30, and a message is shown indicating whether the student has qualified (i.e., scored above 15). The interface is simple and user-friendly, with a clean layout using modern design elements like gradients, rounded corners, and shadows. Input fields are validated to ensure the entered marks are within the valid ranges. The calculator provides immediate feedback, enhancing the user experience with dynamic result calculation and interactive alerts.
