This project is an Internal Marks Calculator designed to help students accurately calculate their internal marks based on their performance in assignments and midterm exams. The calculator allows students to input their scores for two assignments and two midterm exams, each with predefined maximum marks (10 for assignments and 35 for midterms). The program then calculates the average of the assignment marks and a weighted average of the midterm marks, giving greater weight to the higher-scoring midterm.

The final result is displayed as the total internal marks out of 30, along with a message indicating whether the student has qualified (i.e., achieved a score above 15). The user interface is simple and intuitive, featuring a clean layout with modern design elements such as gradients, rounded corners, and shadows. Input fields are validated to ensure that the entered marks fall within the valid range, preventing errors. The calculator provides immediate feedback, enhancing the user experience with real-time result computation and interactive alerts. This tool aims to simplify the evaluation process and provide students with a clear understanding of their academic performance.
